## Questions
1. How this code can sort number from smaller to larger
 
Answer:this code use bubblesort way.its have bool to select the case of the number.if the number is larger than each one.the bool will go false.and when its false.its will get in to for loop to do the process.at the end of the solution the bool will change to true.
